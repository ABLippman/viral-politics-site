	<h1>Viral Political Action</h1>
	<h2> Simon Johnson and Andrew Lippman</h2>

	<p>3+3 units, seminar (3 units) or as seminar+project (6 units)</p>
	<p>Meets Thursdays 5:30-7PM <strong>(dinner will be provided),</strong> and in biweekly project sessions in E14-348F (precise timing of those sessions to be announced)</p>

	<p>Democracy thrives on an informed public, and it fails when propaganda distorts truth and people lose faith in institutions of information and governance.   It also fails when people feel humiliated and motivated by bias instead of reason.  Over the past year we have seen a rise to prominence of new sources of public information as well as new techniques for organizing and mobilizing political action.
	This seminar will consider recent social, behavioral, and political analysis with the goal of creating a new set of grassroots tools and applications to enable diverse populations to become politically active mobilizers, which we will do as class projects.  There are 469 congressional (House and Senate) elections in 2018 occurring throughout the US; if we are successful in this seminar, we will help ensure that these results reflect the true will of the people.  And we will learn the dynamics of public opinion and action in 2017.
	This seminar will meet in two parts.  We will have weekly 5:30 - 7PM dinner discussions with periodic invited guest speakers, and a project unit where groups will design and build test viral organizing apps.  Students can sign up for the dinners and/or the project component (additional credit). There will be tutorial and demonstration sessions for projects.</p>
	<p>Target audience: graduate students and advanced undergraduates.  The project teams will be hands-on and cross-functional using tools developed at the Media Lab.
